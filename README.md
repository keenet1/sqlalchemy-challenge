## Repository Overview:
This repository contains three folders:
- Starter_code: contains the starter code provided in the module exercise
- Resources: contains the hawaii_measurements.csv, hawaii_stations.csv, and the hawaii.sqlite database
- Completed_Assignment: contains my completed homework files (climate_analysis.ipynb and app_completed.py)

## Part 1: Anaysis of Climate Data
For part 1 of the homework assignment, Python and SQLAlchemy were used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a Honolulu, Hawaii climate database. The analysis was performed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The results include an analysis of precipitation data along with an analysis of weather station data.

## Part 2: Designing a Flask API
In part 2 of the homework assignment, Flask was used to create an API based on our Part 1 queries. The API welcomes the user, and then presents them with a list of the available routes to explore.
